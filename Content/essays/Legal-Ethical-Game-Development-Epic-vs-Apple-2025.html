      <h2 id="case-overview">Case Overview</h2>
      <p>Epic Games vs Apple Inc. was a lawsuit battle and dispute between the two companies, that went on from May to September 20, 2021. The case was handled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
      <p>It was initiated in August 2020, with Epic contending Apple’s restrictions on app distribution on their platforms were unlawful, by claiming the regulations on in-app purchases violated antitrust under the California Unfair Competition Law.</p>

      <h2 id="parties">Parties Involved</h2>
      <p><strong>Epic Games, Inc.:</strong> Major developer and publisher based in North Carolina, founded by current CEO Tim Sweeney in 1991. Initially founded as Potomac Computer Systems, they were a first-party games developer, before rebranding to Epic MegaGames in 1992 following the modest success of ZZT(1991), then later on to Epic Games in 1999 after moving its headquarters to its current location in North Carolina.</p>
      <p>The major turning point in their history was the development of Unreal Engine in 1998, first used in the company's sci-fi FPS Unreal. It was first designed as a proprietary engine, but quickly became a commercial product licensed by multiple developers. Overtime, its become possible the most successful tools within the industry, with a major emphasis on high-end graphics, rendering, scalability and lighting tools. Unreal Engine 5 is the latest iteration of the engine, used in Fortnite(2017), Rocket League(2015) and Gears of War(2006) to name a few. As of 2023, Epic are still a private company and have an equity valuation of over $30billion according to Traxcn.</p>
      <p><strong>Apple, Inc:</strong> Multinational technology company based in Cupertino, California. Originally founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as a PC company with the release of the Apple I and II. Over the years, they steadily grew into a global leader in consumer electronics, software and digital services. Their image and change into the modern “Apple”, some would argue started in 2007 with the release of the iPhone, which redefined the mobile phone market and also laid the foundation for dominance in the mobile ecosystems.</p>
      <p>In 2008, they launched the App Store, a digital marketplace that allowed developer to distribute their apps for the iPad and iPhone, in a 70/30 split with the company. They promoted this model as a way of maintaining product quality and security on their store and for their users. Under the current CEO, Tim Cook, they’ve expanded its services revenue through Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and other subscription-based platforms, furthering their lead in the space. As of 2025, they are valued at over $ 2 trillion, and are constantly in the top 3 most valuable companies, alongside Microsoft and Nvidia according to Traccon</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="contextual-history">
      <h2 id="contextual-history">Contextual History</h2>
      <p>The case's origins date back to almost as early as 2015. Revenue shares at the time, with online storefronts starting to pick up major traction, were a huge debate. During this period, Steam, Microsoft Store, and a host of other companies had a 25-30% average revenue split with developers. Apple and Google, on their app stores, also had a 70/30% developer and publisher split in place.</p>
      <p>Tim Sweeney, CEO and co-founder of Epic Games, argued that the 30% industry average on digital distribution platforms was too high in an article from PCGamesN (Scott-Jones, 2017). He argued for an 8% average, and that Steam for example, would still remain profitable with this lower rate. One of the reasons for this, was the ever decreasing cost in digital delivery over physical copies. On the digital side, marketing can almost all exclusively be on the storefront and close to zero marketing outside of that. The issue wasn’t just a financial one, it also started to touch on principles of open access, competition and the supposed autonomy of developers on “open” platforms.</p>
      <p>He also argued it only made sense for a higher revenue split on consoles, which had high investment thresholds on hardware often sold below costs to remain affordable to consumers, but not on mobile and open platforms. Consoles for example are often sold at a loss for most of their lifecycle. Sony’s Jim Ryan claimed that the consoles will become profitable eventually, later on into their lifecycle. He also stated that the PS4 was the first console that held its higher $299( around R5000-6500) while still being profitable for multiple years, with the PS2 for example, have its price cut down to almost half the price. The PS5 being one of the only consoles that could break even after only a year on sale is another great exception, according to a report from gaming news site PushSquare(Tailby, 2024).</p>
      <p>In 2018, Epic launched their own store Epic Games Store(EGS) as a direct challenger and competitor to Steam and other digital distribution platforms. The promise from the start was a revenue cut more friendly and enticing to developers with a 88/12 split, with Epic only taking the 12%. It was more of a statement to prove to competitors that the status quo of 30% was too high for the average developer, using their own platform as a showcase for it. They were essentially putting their money where their mouth was. EGS also integrates with Unreal Engine acting as a hub for games and the engine. They pushed the envelope even further with the launch of the Epic MegaGrants program in 2019. This program funded smaller studios and developers using Unreal Engine in their game development. There are additional requirements listed on their website; however, the pro developer angle they took was an interesting one from the start. They are not without any criticism however, one of those being the far smaller library; lack of features compare to Steam, like the rating system, social and community-driven features.</p>
      <p>While the more open PC platform was easier to get into, Epic’s next issue was getting their games on Apple App Store. The Apple App Store, requires developers to go through a review process, adhere to strict content and functionality guidelines, and a host of other hurdles, all in the name of security and quality control. The biggest one, however, was the non-negotiable in-app purchase(IAP) system set in place to ensure Apple receives their 30% commission on all digital transactions made on devices running on iOS.</p>
      <p>Epic’s argument of a monopoly started with this, particiularly with the lack of alternatives to their payment system and no app distribution out the App Store. The Apple App Store, requires developers to go through a review process, adhere to strict content and functionality guidelines, and a host of other hurdles, all in the name of security and quality control. The biggest one, however, was the non-negotiable in-app purchase(IAP) system set in place to ensure Apple receives their 30% commission on all digital transactions made on devices running on iOS.</p>
      <p>The confrontation became public officially in August 2020 with the internally codenamed “Project Liberty” by Epic. It involved an intentional violation of Apple’s IAP by bypassing the 30% commission, by introducing a direct payment option for in-game content in Fortnite on iOS and Android. Fortnite was removed shortly from the App Store, within a few hours. The response from Epic Games, was a lawsuit, revealed in the form of a 1-minute video, titled "Nineteen Eighty Fortnite", as a riff on Apple's own "1984" ad directed by Ridley Scott. The lawsuit was for anticompetition and antitrust behavior, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. At the same time, they also filed a temporary restraining order against Apple to prevent the removal of any OS tools on Unreal Engine. This was on a direct threat that they had received if they had violated the store IAP. This is where the battle also started to affect the wider group of developers and not just EG.</p>
      <p>On the other end of this, there was a similar lawsuit filed against Google and the Google Play Store, for the same antitrust and anticompetitive. In their claim, Epic claimed that Google’s payment system on their App Store was in direct violation of the Sherman Act and California Cartwright Act. To be specific,Section 1 of the Sherman Act, “describes and prohibits specific conduct deemed to be anticompetitive”, while the Cartwright Act mirrors most of these provisions, but many enacting and applying them to transaction/commerce within the state of California, where Apple and Google are headquartered.</p>
      <p>Apple's response on this, before the legal proceedings and showdown, was in defense of their IAP. They stated that Epic Games’ approach was a delibarate violation and breaking of the long-standing developer agreements. The response was wholly grounded on the Store review guidelines and their Developer Program. License Agreement. In both of them, they have an outline of the only conditions under which any third-party apps can operate within their ecosystem. From the very start, in 2008, they have been receiving a share of all revenue relating to in-app purchases, digital goods and services sold on their storefront. As touched on earlier, the rationale here, that having the strict guidelines and rules allows for : security and fraud prevention, user privacy and consistency in user experience by keeping the quality of all apps high.</p>
      <p>On the store guidelines(Section 3.1.1), they state:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In terms of reputational standpoint, Apple framed its stance on the situation as being pro-consumer instead of anti competition. They compared their business approach on storefronts in conjunction to the same one used by Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft on their consoles, who also had a 30% commission charge and control payment. They doubled down on the 30% being the status quo and industry standard, also stating developers benefit from being on their platform, instead of it being a predatory transaction as framed by Epic. In addition to this, they claimed that the complaint was a misinterpretation of how competition is at play within the mobile phone space, when compared to consoles and PC. iOS wasn’t a monopoly, just one of the many alternatives available to Android, console, and web platforms through which they could monetize and sell their products. Finally, they claimed that Epic's complaint had nothing to do with actual fairness and antitrust. It was rather an attempt to be on their platform, enjoy the benefits it comes with while still bypassing fees. They viewed Epic’s position as being dishonest, opportunistic, and hypocritical by being against the same rules that allowed them to thrive as a company. Despite the lawsuits, Epic did not seek any monetary compensation or damages in either of the cases, but rather sought to break what they deemed to be a monopoly by the two parties.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="proceedings">
      <h2 id="proceedings">Case and Court Proceedings</h2>
      <p>The legal court proceding began on the 3rd of May 2021, and ran up until the 24th of the same month(3 weeks), in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California. It was presided by Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers. It was during the advent COVID-19 pandemic, with parties involved adhering to the safety protocols.</p>
      <h3>Witness Testimonies</h3>
      <p><strong>Epic Games</strong> 
      Tim Sweeney, delivered testimony about why he believed Apple was running a monopoly that was stifling and harmful to competition. He was followed up after wards by the Xbox vice-president and concluding on the first day with testimonies from the Apple executives, including Tim Cook.
      During this first session, Epic stated their want was for Apple to “open up the iPhone”, allowing developers to distribute apps outside the proprietary system. Apple rejected the monopoly label, claiming that would make the iPhone less secure and safe, according to The Washington Post (Liao, 2021).</p>
    </section>
    <section aria-labelledby="major-themes">
      <h2 id="major-themes">Major Themes</h2>
      <h3>1 Market Definition</h3>
      <p>Probably the most central issue at play was relating to market definition. This is always crucial. I used the commentary from Robins Kaplan LLP as a basis of this section on Market Defintion.</p>
      <p>In this case, the market, is the one where iPhone users can make in app purchases(within the Fortnite game and other apps) as the only monopoly.
      Epic defined the market as “iOS app distribution”, which is wholly owned and controlled by Apple, with no alternative app store, sideloading (the ability to get apps onto devices either directly from the developer/publisher or 3rd party) or most importantly, alternative payment methods. They asserted that :- Apple is the only gatekeeper to all app transitions - developers can't make use of their own sites direct to the user - the 30% commission and anti-steering constitute an abuse of market power, because in this case, unlike on android, users can use alternative publishers and distribution as alternatives. Devs are locked into the iOS ecosystem without any alternative.</p>
      <p>Apple’s counter definition of the market, was much broader, “all digital gaming transactions”, and included consoles, PCs, cloud gaming and web platforms. Their argument was standing on the cross platform availability of games like Fortnite. The game was for example still playable on all other platforms except iOS after the ban and removal. They also countered the monopoly argument, by stating that their policies on the App Store were just competitive and not as harmful as stated to be.</p>
      <p>Judge Gonzalez Rodgers, rejected both of these definitions, claiming that they were both on extreme ends in an attempt to make arguments without nuance. On her compromise, she ruled the market and defined the market as “digital mobile gaming transactions”. She stated, that Epic’s definition here was an overreach, while also stating that comparing the market does not consist of the wider platforms they defined. The compromise in definition seemed to accept that Apple wasn’t in competition with PC and console as they described, but that also noted that Android and the Google Play Store are part of the mobile gaming distribution instead of being sole. The court did however, note a very large marketshare on their said. At the time, the claim was of more than half marketshare revenue at 55% in mobile gaming was high, but not a monopoly. This is an interesting verdict as well, when considering Android takes up around 70% of the mobile operating system marketshare globally, while iOS still generates the higher revenue according to a 2024 report by PocketGamer(Astle, 2024). With this information in mind, the court applied the rule of reason, in that Apple’s market share and practices are very restrictive, but ruled against a monopoly because of a lack of evidence in exclusionary and harmful practices.</p>
      <h3>2 App Store Policies and the Anti-Steering Provisions</h3>
      <p>The anti-steering rules on the App Store, are found on Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.3 of their App Store Review Guidelines. At the time, they includes : - offering alternative payment methods when in app. - routing and steering the user away from the app to pay on the publishers site for example - any communication with the user directly about alternative pricing off the app.</p>
      <p>The provisions essentially stop the user from being able to leave and get away from Apple’s IAP. This is where the California Unfair Competition Law, which prohibited any illegal, fraudulent or unfair business practive.</p>
      <p>In this arguement, the court ruled in favour of Epic on the specific claim. They found their practices to be :- harmful and dangerous to users, because customers would be paying higher amounts without knowing that they can get cheaper options, even if they existed outside the app - not fair, because they were preventing any sort of pricing competition and not allowing customer choice - without any reasoning or business based justification for this, apart from just wanting to get more revenue</p>
      <p>The outcome, was seen as a landmark decision. For the first time, Apple were not in full control of what happens on their platforms and app distribution. The injunctions issued, stated that they had to include metadata buttons, external links and other CTA to allow for purchasing mechanics and additional IAP.</p>
      <h3>3 Security and privacy justifications</h3>
      <p>Forever, one of the strongest justifications for the “walled garden” approach taken by Apple on their closed ecosystem, has been for privacy and user security. They’ve argued that, it maintains the user privacy and security</p>
      <p>Key arguments on Apples side are :---</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malware and virus prevention , is more prevented when they can have a very aggressive review on what goes onto their stores before the user gets access to it. These are admittedly more prevalent on open OS systems, like Android or Linux.</li>
        <li>Preventing fraud from cloned apps and fake publishers, who could be phishing as the real ones. As well as fraudulent transactions, which may not be on apple to help with, they take a preventative approach here</li>
        <li>Maintaining the trust of the user and their brand reputation, and lowering the control could remove this brand trust.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The court ruled in favour of Apple here. They acknowledged their points of security justification as being genuine and honest. At the same time, however, they also ruled that the justification for every level of control that Apple had, was not sufficient.</p>
      <p>They overextended according to rulings, in particular the ban of something like external links, as being of no relationship to overall security goals. While maintaining security is important, going beyond all forms of user agency is not at all fair.</p>
      <p>The case concluded on the 24th of May 2021, with the court and the Judge ruling in favour of Apple. They are mandating the big change, however, on their anti-steering provisions, as being anticompetitive and unfair.</p>
    </section>
    <section aria-labelledby="impact-after">
      <h2 id="impact-after">Impact After</h2>
      <p>Following the rulling in September 2021, the legal landscape has had a continued shift and evolution. In particular, there has been even more scrutiny in just Apples closed off environment, but a host of others as well.</p>
      <p>Apple's response to the injunction was initially in partial compliance with the ruling on the anti-steering: - they’ve now included external links and buttons for devs to their own sites for app payments, while still requiring the developer to submit a request for approval. They also still take a 27% commission on any external sales made from iOS apps.</p>
      <p>Epic has continued criticism on this, stating they are actively undermining the court's ruling, and that they are still making it very difficult for alternatives. As of 2025, Apple is still under legal pressure, now from U.S regulators as well, who are arguing this is a continued abuse of their platform power.</p>
      <p>There’s been a larger global push on scrutiny as well. Probably the most well
known, being with the European Union(EU). The new Digital Markets Act they established in 2023, framed Apple as a “gatekeeper”,  requiring them to open up the app store, offer sideloading, and third-party app stores like on
Android(European Commission, 2022). They’ve again complied with this, partially, by announcing plans to introduce alternatives. As of 2025, this includes SetApp Mobile and AltStore PAL. Apple are still charging a “core
technology fee” for non-App Store downloads.
      </p>
      <p>The most impactful post-Epic v. Apple legal battle, however, went even further away from software, into hardware. In 2022, the EU passed legislation that mandated that all brand-new smartphones, tablets, and computers include USB-C charging ports as standard by the end of 2024 (European Commission, 2024). The goal here was to reduce customer inconvenience, e-waste, and most importantly, the usage of proprietary connectors by vendors - a direct hit at Apple’s Lightning Port. Apple was again very reluctant to comply, claiming this was an overreach of power and that it would stifle any kind of innovation. The direct threat was the ban of any iPhone sales within the EU if they didn't comply. In 2023, Apple introduced the USB-C charging port on their new iPhone, marking again, a shift in what they can do on their platform and control over customers. This specific one is ironic, considering Apple was a major component in the development of USB-C and Thunderbolt technologies.</p>
    </section>
    <section aria-labelledby="key-takeaways">
      <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways as a Developer</h2>
      <p>The key argument here was on platform control. It directly affects pricing and choice for the consumer. The platform owners, do not just deliver apps to their clients, but also control how and what is given to them, and how they can be monetized. So called walled gardens and closed off ecosystems, might have control and security for the user, but trade it for openness. Some competing services and apps could be completely lost to the customer.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of a game developer, it is important to understand the platform requirements and agreements. Even if in protest for “good” like in Epic’s supposed case, you are still responsible for the outcome; in this case Epic had to pay legal fees and damages.When planning revenue models, it is important to consider the platform cuts. Finding viable alternatives like releasing the game as freemium, ad-based or a hybrid of some sort with in
game purchases and so on. As a smaller-scale independent developer, most of the considerations I have taken to note are on the side of legal compliance, creative control and long term sustainability. While I may not be a owner of a large platform like Apple or Epic, this does not make my responsibilities less significant. The case showed that even the largest companies aren't above scrutiny. It is a reminder of how we have to be intentional in how we want to inform our audience and customers.</p>
