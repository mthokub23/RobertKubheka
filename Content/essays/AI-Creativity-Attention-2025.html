  <article class="content" tabindex="0">
    <p>In recent years, the rapid growth and advancements in artificial intelligence and it’s technologies have transformed the way we consume, create and engage with media in the digital space. The AI-powered algorithms have become an essential part of how creators approach their work. In the essay, I will explore the evolving relationship between AI and creativity, by examining the impact these algorithms have on:  the content we consume, artistic expression and the future of art within the digital space.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="history">
      <h2 id="history">A short history</h2>
      <p>One of the earliest examples of an algorithmic Artificial Intelligence program, was the Logic Theorist program (Figure 1), developed by Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and Cliff Shaw. The program was a complete information processing system, designed to discover proofs for theorems in symbolic logic. An absolute revelation in computing at time of release, it was capable of adjusting its methods based on prior outcomes and environment inputs, as opposed to traditional programs (Newell & Simon, 1956).</p>
      <p class="pull">The Logic Theorist showed early signs of systems that learn through process rather than fixed rules — groundwork for machine learning, automated decision making and natural language processing.</p>

      <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms and what we see</h2>
      <p>The Logic Theorist, pseudocode (Figure1)
 We were already seeing signs of a system that was learning as it goes, even for the 1950s. This meant, computers could go beyond just simple arithmetics and start using problem solving methods and processes that began to mimic humans. It was, of course, groundwork for what would become the future development of AI, particularly in fields like machine learning, automated decision making and natural language processing. In the present, they have evolved beyond just rule-based systems, now leveraging even larger amounts of data and models to go about making decisions, predictions and more. YouTube, TikTok and Spotify, make use of AI driven systems that analyse user data to create content delivery. They constantly track user watchtime, search history and engagement metrics, redlining them dynamically to create personalized content for the user. Unlike the Logic Theory, the modern AIs don't operate within predefined and set logic rules, rather continuously adapting through machine learning. They get better the more data they get from the user. Algorithms influence on the consumer</p>

      <p>For this analysis, I will be looking at the topic from the perspective of the artist and the consumer. Originally, users were highly dependent on word of mouth and reviews as forms of recommendations, while physical media was still highly popular. The entire process of acquiring then watching the media/video was a complete experience on its own. There was a cost involved in this however, both on finances and time. Even during the initial stages of digital media, this was very much still the case. Algorithmic AIs have basically streamlined the entire process, allowing for the user to focus almost solely on content consumption. Having platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Netflix, Spotify and so on, eliminates multiple factors relating to acquiring something to watch and enjoy. While this is good, it raises the question on how much influence the algorithms have on not only what you consume, but how they can dictate trends and popular media. As suggested by Steven Mailloux in Convention and Context(1983), conventions evolve constantly under the influence of cultural and historical contexts. In the current modern age, the algorithms work similarly by turning individual engagement into collective trends. In short, they can be used by their companies and owners to actively dictate what users can see, which media has visibility, and what cultural narratives are given center stage over the other. Petrescu and Krishen(2020), in their article, The dilemma of social media algorithms and analytics,  argue that the control and manipulation of algorithms have a direct and significant impact on society, with tech companies having the ability to prioritize and shape how and what information is presented to their users(p. 188). This point goes further beyond entertainment and creatives, but even touching the political and ideological hemisphere. The counter argument here is that this was always the case, but even more so now with how much more data Netflix or YouTube receives from its user and equally how much more the user consumes.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="creators">
      <h2 id="creators">Influence on the creator</h2>
      <p>The creator sits in a weird position. The modern artist has already strayed away from just being a creator. With spaces like TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Twitter(X), they are also performers of the algorithm, shaping their work around dictated engagement from algorithms rather than just their artistic vision. They’re needing to constantly modify their creative processes to cater to algorithmic trends and metrics, which could have a direct impact on the level of work they output. This has led to a homogenization of content, where originality often takes the backseat in the search for formulaic virality. Trends disappear as quickly as they emerge, not because of cultural shifts, but because of the algorithms pushing certain types of content to the forefront based on engagement data.</p>

      <p>TikToks rise to being the biggest social media platform for example is a direct result of its hyper optimized recommendation algorithm, which prioritizes engagement above everything else. Unlike traditional social media platforms, which were dictated by subscribers, follower count and chronological feeds, TikToks For You Page(For You Page) ensures that any piece of content can be viral. TikTok’s reach is also having an impact on other primary platforms made for content consumption/creation. YouTube’s algorithm for example, in recent years, has undergone significant changes. Originally, YouTube’s recommendation system was primarily based on subscribers, watch time and search rankings, favouring longer videos with constructed titles, thumbnails and click through rates. However, shorter, more dynamic videos drive higher engagement. The company like many others prioritized shorter content through features like YouTube Shorts. This has again forced creators to adjust their content strategies, focusing on fast-paced content.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="future">
      <h2 id="future">What does this mean for the future artist and consumer?</h2>
      <p>As these algorithmic AIs continue to grow and evolve, their role in influencing culture and creative expression will simultaneously do so. While concerns about homogenization and cultural creative agency are very much valid, one major positive we can look at is the lower barrier to entry. It has enabled more people to participate in artistic creation more than ever before. Digital platforms are no longer just spaces for content consumption, but interactive ecosystems where media are constantly reshaped by both creators and audiences. TikTok’s algorithm for example has made it way easier than it already was to create. Financial and hardware barriers have almost been completely eliminated, which fits with Papaneks argument from What is Design(1984). He argues that design shouldn’t just be for experts but fundamental for human activity, actively shaping our everyday tasks to artistic creation(1984, p.4). Moreover, as suggested by Mailloux, the platforms don’t just reflect trends but actively shape them, turning short-form content into the dominant artistic convention, ushering new expressions of art in relation to the digital space.</p>

      <p>Cultural engagement will very likely see a line between the artist and consumer be further blurred, where creativity is more collaborative and iterative. How the art is made is also being influenced, distributed and reinterpreted by AI-powered curation mediums. The risk of homogenization could be looked at through the lens of the creators potentially becoming better, with iteration of conventions over pure innovation. The future looks way more at art being iterative rather than groundbreaking.</p>
